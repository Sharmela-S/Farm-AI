## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem**: "Python is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Install Python from python.org
- **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

**Problem**: Package installation fails
- **Solution**: Run INSTALL.bat as Administrator

**Problem**: Virtual environment error
- **Solution**: 
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python -m venv venv --clear
  ```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem**: Port 5000 already in use
- **Solution**: Close other applications using port 5000
- Or change port in app.py (line: `app.run(port=5000)`)

**Problem**: "Module not found" error
- **Solution**: Run INSTALL.bat again
- Make sure virtual environment is activated

**Problem**: Browser doesn't open
- **Solution**: Manually open browser
- Go to: http://localhost:5000
